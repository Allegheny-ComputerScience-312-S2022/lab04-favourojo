Please answer the following questions using **clear and meaningful language**. It is expected that there will be at least 50 words per answer. Do not use one-liners to respond.


#### 1)

 - Describe the general functionality of your database. What is the database _supposed_ to do?

 ```
 TODO

 ```

#### 2)

  - Explain your data: give the reference (or hyperlink) and discuss the purpose of the dataset. For instance, what is this data set? How was it collected? What information does it contain? What kind of trust can be placed in this dataset?

	```
	TODO

	```

#### 3)
- Describe your database at the _View Schema_ level. How will users interact with the database? If the database were scaled-up to handle a larger set of data or more users, how would the _View Schema_ change if at all? Explain your thinking.

 ```
 TODO

 ```

#### 4)
- Describe your database at the _Logical Schema_ level. Discuss the tables, attributes and the relationships that exist them and the other parts of the database.

 ```
 TODO

 ```


#### 5)
 - Describe your database at the _Internal Schema_ level. What hardware is necessary to run this database? How would the schema change for a larger application of this database?
	```
	TODO

	```

#### 6)

 - Archival: Discuss how the data will be physically stored? What are the imitations of this storage system?

 ```
 TODO

 ```

#### 7a)

 - Ask an intelligent question _involving three of the tables_ and then give a query and result to answer that query.

  - Question

 	```
 	TODO

 	```

  - Query

 	```
 	TODO

 	```

  - Result

 	```
 	TODO

 	```


#### 7b)

- Ask another intelligent question _involving three of the tables_ and then give a query and result to answer that query.

 - Question

	```
	TODO

	```

 - Query

	```
	TODO

	```

 - Result

	```
	TODO

	```

#### 8)

Imagine that your database schema was adopted by a hospital to be used as a system to manage all their past, current and future medical records.

Explain how easily it would be to add medical data to your current schema to create a functioning database. How could this medical data be fitted into your established schema? What problems would exist?

```
TODO

```

#### 9)

 - Imagine that your database was successfully readapted to manage the hospital's medical records data (and is currently being used thanks to a few modifications). What is one of the largest concerns of privacy or security that you could imagine if the exact _logical schema_ was known by malicious users. Explain your thinking.

 ```
 TODO

 ```

#### 10)
 - Concerning the _view schema_ or _physical schema_ levels of the database, What security concerns for the data would become apparent if either of these levels were to become public knowledge?

```
TODO

```

#### 11)

- What kinds of data in this medical database would be best **not** to hold to prevent trouble in the event of a breach? Explain your thinking.

```
TODO

```

#### 12)

 - Describe the most ideal way for a typical user to interact with this database. For instance, what kinds of skills and hardware would be necessary for the hospital staff to use the system?

 ```
 TODO

 ```


#### 13)

  - You have been told that all medical information is available to all users of the database, regardless of a user's role in the hospital. Is this a "feature" or a "flaw" in the design of the system? With this knowledge of general database use, what changes would you make to the system (if any) to fix this issue? Explain your thinking.

  ```
  TODO

  ```
